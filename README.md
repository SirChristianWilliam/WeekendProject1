# Project Name
JQUERY Calculator
 
## Description

Allowing employers to manually enter in employee information. The information will be added to an array that will then call a function to calculate the monthly salary total of all the employees that have been entered. If an employee and their information needs to be deleted, you can simply press the "delete" button on that row and it will disappear from the state array of employees. It will also (mostly) subtract that deleted employees monthly cost from the curent total monthly cost. If there are no employees, the cost is zero. 

I completed the base required goals of this project within 4-5 hours. I have spent about 25 hours working on the stretch goals. I have completed 99% of the stretch goals. I am excited to see what I need to do to make it 100% while in class tomorrow.
